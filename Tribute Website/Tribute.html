   <h2>PREAMBLE</h2> 

   <p>Below is a quote from Marcus Cicero that would be instructive to us:</p>
   <blockquote> No man can be ignorant
    that he must die, nor
    be dare he may not
                  this very day </blockquote>
    <p>
    The above quotation encapsulates the inevitabilityand unpredictability of death, the fluidity and vanity of human existence; like flowers, we blossom in the morning and fade away before sunset.
    
    The path we tread in life had been chosen for us long before we were borne by our creator. He alone determines the brevity or longevity of our existence. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of America aptly captured the essence of life when he posited that, “In the end, it is not the years in your life that count, it is the life in your years.”Though Engineer IdongesitUmoren’s sojourn on earth can be adjudged by human standard as brief, but by God’s design, Engineer Umoren has accomplished his purpose, completed his race and transited to a higher glory.
    
    Today, humanity stands agog, amid phenomenal tears and mixed feelings to accord last respect to this rare breed of God’s Creation, a ‘primus inter pares’ (first among equals).Ecclesiastes, the Bible’s philosophical book, proffers the notion that indeed everything balances out and everything comes full circle; it posits thus:“To everything, there is a season. Atime to be born and a time to die; a time to mourn and a time to dance.” (Ecclesiastes 3:14).
    
    Indeed we celebrated his birth, mourned when news of his demise broke out, but we rejoice in the conviction of his reception in a celestial home. </p>
 <h2>
     EARLY LIFE AND FORMATIVE PROCESSES
    </h2>
<p>
    Late Obong (Engr) IdongesitUmoren was born on Sunday, 7thOctober, 1962, as the first fruit, the womb opener to the family of Late Elder (Chief) EdetAkpanUmoren and Eti-Eka Mary EdetUmoren of AsantingNkwongo village in Ikono Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. As events in later days would prove, this bundle of joy grew to become a ray of hope and channel of blessings for his family, siblings, community and all who came in contact with him.

    Born to strict disciplinarian parents, typical of that generation of teachers, young ‘ID’ displayed signs of his future greatness at a very tender age in life. He demonstrated a passionate love for learning early on. Due to the nomadic nature of the teaching profession in those days, his father was always moving from one station to another. Thus, little ID’s primary education took him through Government Primary School, EwetOffot, Uyo; Methodist Central School, NkoOtoro, Abak and Methodist Primary School, Asanting, Ikono where he bagged DISTINCION GRADE in the First School Leaving Certificate Examination in 1974. He remarkably distinguished himself while under tutelage in his formative years. He then proceeded to Lutheran High School, ObotIdim, IbesikpoAsutan where he obtained his West African School Certificate in 1979.His knack for probing deeper in order to enlarge the frontiers of his knowledge earned him the sobriquets ‘QUESTIONEER and RESEARCHER’ in Primary and Secondary Schools respectively. He had an incredible and voracious desire for sterling academic pursuits and blazed continually with impeccable academic potentials. In 1979, he gained admission into the prestigious Moscow Institute of Engineering, Russia, where he obtained a Bachelor degree (B. Eng.) in Civil Engineering in 1984 and a Master’s degree (M. Eng.) in Construction and Structural Engineering in 1986.
    
    It is worthy of note that his departure to and return from Russia was marked with pomp and ceremony by his community, who reckoned him a worthyAmbassador of his community. And indeed, he made them proud with his prolific academic exploits. On his return to Nigeria, Engr. Umoren served his fatherland in the mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme at Yaba College Of Technology, Lagos.
</p>
<h2>
    ADULTHOOD, SOCIAL LIFE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
</h2>
<p>
    Engr. Umoren was a “Workaholic” who brought professionalism and expertise to bear wherever he found himself.

At the conclusion of the mandatory one year NYSC programme, Engr. Umoren cut his teeth in Project Engineering and Construction in a company called Home Construction & Dredging Nig. Ltd., Lagos in 1987. He was posted to Ogun State as Project Engineer to oversee the construction of Ogun State Political parties Headquarters and Political parties Headquarters across 15 Local Government Areas of Ogun State.

He completed and delivered them in record time, his competence and proficiency never in doubt. He was astute, committed and diligent in all assignments delegated to him.


He had a prolific working experience spanning more than three decades in the following companies:
<ul>
<li> ARON (NIG): 1991-1995</li>
<li> BOUYGUES OFFSHORE INTERNATIONAL NIGERIA: 1995-2002</li>
<li> MARLUM (NIG) LTD, NIGERIA: 2002-Till death</li>
</ul>
Some of the signature projects he supervised as Project Manager include, among others;

<ul>
<li> Construction of Ogun State Cultural Centre, Abeokuta.</li>
<li> Construction of Ogun State Secretariat Complex, OkeMosan, Abeokuta.</li>
<li> Rehabilitation of Igboho Earth Dam, Igboho, Oyo State.</li>
<li> Construction of Temple complex for the Church of Christ of Latter Days Saints, Aba, Nigeria.</li>
<li> Enugu State University of Technology permanent site, Agbani, Enugu.</li>
<li> Construction of International Conference Centre, Enugu.</li>
<li> Construction of Ebeano Tunnel, Enugu</li>
<li> Enugu State Judiciary complex, Enugu.</li>
</ul>
Always in search of new challenges, and breaking new frontiers, Engr. Umoren founded TRAMIE LTD, a building and civil engineering firm in 1994. As the MD/CEO, he has nurtured the company into a brand synonymous with professionalism and prompt delivery of various construction projects; it has since blossomed to glorious and envious heights.

Engr. Umoren was a member of various professional bodies among which are:
<ul>
<li> Council of Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN)</li>
<li> Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE)</li>
<li> Nigerian Institution of Structural Engineers</li>
<li> American Society of Civil Engineers</li>
</ul>
He was a very sociable, amiable and an altruistic individual who interacted and fostered friendship among people despite his busy work schedule.

He was a member of the following associations:
<ul>
<li> G74, an association of Old Students of Lutheran High School, ObotIdim, Ibesikpo</li>
<li> Association of Russian-trained Professionals in Nigeria</li>
<li> Uyo Sports Club</li>
<li> Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC), Zone 6, Calabar.</li>
</ul>
Engr. Umoren was a frontline mass mobilizer both at the Local Government and State levels. His exposure, clout and sphere of influence in the community spurred him to venture into politics.

He saw politics as a vehicle for service delivery to his community and beyond. Little wonder, he was elected Chairman, Ikono Ward 2 PDP Elders Forum, a postion he held till death.

As a very active member of the Divine Mandate Organization in 2019, he worked tirelessly, traversing the nooks and crannies of the State to ensure the re-election of His Excellency, Deacon Udom Emmanuel.

He was also a member, Board of Trustees, the Transformation Initiative; Member, PDP Stakeholders, Ikono. His empathy for the under-privileged and uncommon passion towards the development of his community did not go unnoticed by his people.
He was therefore conferred with the following chieftaincy titles:

<ul>
<li> ObongUnwamAsantingNkwongo by the AsantingNkwongo Village Council – 2014</li>
<li> Anyie-Akpon of IkotUkoEtor by IkotUkoEtor Village Council, Okon, EssienUdim Local Government Area (His wife’s Village Council) –2014.</li>
<li> Obong Iberedem Ikono by the Paramount Ruler and Palace Council of Ikono – 2017.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    FAMILY/MARITAL LIFE 
</h2>
<p>
    Psalm 37:23 says, “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighted in his way”.

Engr. Umoren’s feet were ordered by God. In one of his frequent work-related trips to Lagos in 1996, he met his ravishingly endowed wife, a paragon of beauty, graceful in carriage and charming in character. He was led in the spirit to discern that he had found his missing rib. ‘Eureka’, he had discovered the love of his life, the young, alluring MARIASTELLA!

However, life’s unpredictable course drew them apart but despite that hiatus, fate brought them back together. Idongesit wasted no time in making bold his intention to the family of late Ette K.J. Udoh of IkotUkoEtor, Okon in EssienUdim Local Government Area.
He received their consent and blessings. After fulfilling the traditional rites and requirements, the marriage was formalized in the secret Registry, Uyo on November 21, 2005. The connubial bliss has been blessed with two (2) adorable children.

He was good, responsible and responsive family man. The yawning gap and gnawing emptiness created by the demise of this loving and caring husband and father can only be imagined.
</p>
<h2>
    CHRISTIAN LIFE AND RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD
</h2>
<p>
    Born and bred in the refined doctrines and creed of Methodist by staunch Methodist parents, Engr. Umoren was baptized at infancy in 1963. Thereafter, young ID, under the guidance of his parents and the Methodist Church, grew imbibing the tenets of Christianity. Poised to lend lethal teeth to his Methodist faith, he was confirmed in 1992. This spiritual exercise coagulated his resolve never to stray from the precepts of God, our Creator. In his youthful days, he was a Chorister and Youth fellowship member.

Engr.Umoren was a Christian in words and in deeds. He held tenaciously onto Methodism till his last breath.
In recognition of his steadfastness and commitment, he was found worthy to be ordained an ELDER of the Methodist Church, Ikono Diocese in 2011 and to add more feathers to his Christian cap, he was conferred with the Conference award of Order of Wesley (OOW) by the Methodist Church, Nigeria in 2013.

Engr. Umoren was a pragmatic and selfless Christian who served God in various capacities including, but not limited to:

<ul>
<li> Diocesan Property adviser, Uyo and Ikono Dioceses</li>
<li> Chairman, Uyo Archdiocese InaugurationCommittee</li>
<li> Chairman, Church Building Committee, Sir S. U. Akpan (SUA) Methodist Church, Ewet Housing Estate, Uyo</li>
<li> Vice Chairman, Men Fellowship, SUA Methodist Church, Ewet Housing Estate, Uyo.</li>
<li> Member, Marriage Counselling Committee, SUA Methodist Church, Ewet Housing Estate, Uyo.</li>
</ul>

He took up membership of Nka Edinyanga, Methodist Church, Asanting Circuit after the demise of his father.

Engr. Umoren was a firm and unapologetic believer in the biblical admonition that faith without goodworks is a nullity. His life reflected the reality that a lamp can never light another lamp unless it continues to burn its own flames. Indeed like John the Baptist, he was a burning and shining lamp who shone brightly and lit men’s path in his earthly sojourn.
</p>
<h2>
    FINAL ISSUES
</h2>
<p>
    Engr. Umoren was always full of life. He was a combination of positive energy and vibrancy in one pack.

But human health is as unpredictable as the outcome of a football match. Though he had an underlying diabetic condition but it was not terminal.

Being one of the major players in Akwa Ibom State Political space coupled with the need to attend to his business interests, coming home was routine for him.

On the 17th of July, 2020, Engineer Umoren arrived Uyo  from Abuja via Ibom Air. Few days after arrival, he took ill and was hospitalized at Ibom Specialist Hospital. Medical Examination revealed a malfunctioning kidney. He underwent dialysis and just when he was showing signs of recovery, the cold hands of death played a fast one on us and he passed on to eternal glory on the 26th of July, 2020.

We have lost a rare gem, our loss, heaven’s gain. You left without saying goodbye….But who are we to fault God’s design and handwriting?

And now, we, your wife and children, your aged mother, your siblings, your relatives, your in-laws, your friends, associates and all your loved ones gather here today to bid you final farewell and say “Goodbye, our Hero”.

You remain forever in our hearts.
Rest on till we meet on the resurrection day.
